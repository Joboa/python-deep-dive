# Python Deep Dive üêç

A structured plan to master Python by combining **Fluent Python (2nd Edition)** with real open-source code reading.  
This repository is designed for experienced programmers who want to go beyond tutorials and truly understand Pythonic idioms, patterns, and advanced techniques.

## Goals

- Read and understand Python core concepts from _Fluent Python_
- Explore and analyze source code from popular libraries (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
- Reproduce, implement, and experiment with code to solidify understanding
- Build a portfolio of Pythonic mini-projects and exercises

## Structure

- Foundations & Data Structures
- Objects, Idioms & Control Flow
- Concurrency & Advanced Topics

Each week includes:

- Fluent Python chapters to read
- Selected source code to study
- Mini coding tasks to implement learned concepts
- Notes & summaries for reflection

## Usage

- Follow the weekly checklist in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md)
- Track progress and experiments in Jupyter notebooks
- Add new exercises, source code analyses
